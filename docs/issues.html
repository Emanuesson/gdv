        As the library has no real community or core-developer this part of the
        documentation is thought as a collection of known problems of higher
        complexity.
      </p>
<p>
        One of the biggest issues is about the general idea how the plotting of
        axes should be implemented in the drawing-cycle of Gtk+.
      </p>
<p>
        Usually the axis-drawing starts with the measurement. As there is in the
        plain beginning no Tic available on an axis, an automatic routine finds
        a rather high value for the pixel-difference between different tics.
      </p>
<p>
        An adjustment to this high value is a rather high number of possible
        Tics. Than these tics will be realized and added to the 
        GdvAxis-Container.
      </p>
<p>
        After that the Axis is realized and space is allocated for the axis and
        every Tic. Now the axis measures the free space again and realizes that
        the space between every tic is much lower than previously thought. So
        the value for the number of tics is automatically adjusted and the
        residual Tics will be removed from the axis.
      </p>
<p>
        The process starts now with a similar situation as in the beginning and
        will be continuing with adding, removing and measuring of Tics. This
        cycle is depicted in the following graphic.
      </p>
<div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="realloc_prob.png"></div></div>
<p>
        It will be really hard to detect such a cycle and break it from within
        the code.
      </p>
<p>
        For the moment this problem is rather simply solved by measuring
        adjusting the number of Tics during the axis-allocation by the space
        needed by the beginning- and ending-Tic, as their values can be easily
        determined or are even fixed.
      </p>
<p>
        Nevertheless, this approach is problematic as in some cases the space
        needed for the beginning- and ending-tic might differ from the space
        needed for the tics in between. A simple example might be an axis
        from 0 to 5e4 with tics at 2.5e4 in between.
      </p>
<p>
        However this effect is at the moment seen as the minor problem.
