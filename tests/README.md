General Information
-------------------

This folder contains an internal test that should not be shipped into a final version. It is meant to test some of the behaviours of this library and might be deprecated. However usually the functionality, that is presented in these test-cases is more fundamental, so it is used to inspect the impact of any new changes and features to old functionality. This process can not be fully automated in the end, but is absolutely necessary to ensure consistency and functionality of the library now and in the future.

However... It might be a better option for future developments to include real unit-tests, that could be inspected automatically. This needs in general a large amount of work... but it would be worth.
