Test8 - time-axis
-----------------

This is just the test-case for the special-widget time-axis. The time-axis was originally implemented into the Gevse-project and was than ported into Gdv-library.

Time-axes and under some circumstances angular-axes provide a good example of axes with non decimal base-values. Therefor this test-scenario aimes to test the automatic settings in cases that contain more difficult and exotic axes-properties.
